I've wanted to mess around with d3 treemaps for a while and figured looking at the most popular baby names  of 2016 would be a decent way to go about doing that. One thing I would like to figure out is an elegant solution to the graph leaves being too small to fit the content in them. These are the most popular boy names of 2016.
